### Exercise 4: Setting Sync Policy & Options

#### Overview

-  Learn various sync Policy & Option provided by ArgoCD
    - auto-prune
    - auto-sync

#### Steps

1. Edit the file in  `manifests/ArgoCD101-GuestbookManifests/kustomization.yaml` comment out `service.yaml`
1. Commit the changes and push to the main branch of your forked repo.
1. Login into ArgoCD using the user id `admin` and `password` (same credentials used in [exercise1][1]).
1. Go to the application and click on the `APP DIFF` button(click on Refresh button to see OutOfSync resource)
1. The service object marked in red needs to be pruned (deleted).
1. Select the sync with prune option, then apply the sync operation. After a successful  sync, the service resource will be deleted.
1. The health of the application will be marked as  `green`, and the state of the application matches the desired state.

#### Optional Step

1. Using Argo CD cli, change the `guestbook` application to sync automatically
